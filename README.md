### Get Assignment Repo
You should have gone through the steps to create a repo on GitHub for this assignment. See this [resource](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/github-classroom-intro.md) if you need help with this step.

### Cloning the Repo
We will clone the GitHub repo from within VS Code instead of the CLI. Follow the directions from this [resource](https://github.com/hoc-courses/shared-resources/blob/main/git-cloning-existing-repo.md), using the steps to use VS Code.

### Overview
VS Code works with project folders. After loading your repo in VS Code, the folder will be visible in the Explorer window.
### Working with Folders/Files
In the Explorer view you can create folders and files either through the File menu or by clicking on the icons that show up when you hover at the top of the project 
 a file named index.html
